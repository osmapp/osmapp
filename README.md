## How to contribute 🐱‍💻

You may [add issues](https://github.com/zbycz/osmapp/issues) here on github, or try to update the code in three simple steps:

1. edit code online (this opens a pull-request) ✏️
2. wait few minutes for a preview URL 💬
3. iterate 🔁

Then just wait for a comment or merge. Don't worry about code style or anything.

> If you are a JS dev, you may also `git clone` / `yarn` / `yarn dev`
