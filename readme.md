## RDD (Random driven development)

This project was made out of pure joy, development is purely random. You don't have to use it, you don't have to contribute.
In case you really want to, be sure to enjoy it. 😁

### Roadmap 🎲🎲🎲

- setup typescript, eslint, readme, contribution guidelines, CI
- localisation – add JSONs with messages, use simple `t()` function
- add layer switcher (all raster layers from osmcz-app)
- add copyright popup
- submit an OSM note when user edits a feature
- more ideas [in wireframes](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B7awz2fKhg6yQ0JqTjhJRFV5aEE)
